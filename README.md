# 265_DataTypes
P02_DataTypes Project

In this project, the purpose was to familiarize ourselves with various different Data Types and their differents perks and downfalls. We created each of them from scratch in order to know the ins and outs of the type. 
Using the structures of a Queue and Stack, I created a Steque, minStack and a Queue with only one pointer. Along with getting these data types to work, it was also important to attempt in making them the most efficient.
